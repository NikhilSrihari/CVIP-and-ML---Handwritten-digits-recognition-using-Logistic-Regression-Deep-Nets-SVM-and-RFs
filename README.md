# CVIP-and-ML---Handwritten-digits-recognition-using-Logistic-Regression-Deep-Nets-SVM-and-RFs

Recognize the given image as one of the digits in 0-9 using the following ML models:
1. Librarless implementation of Logistic Regression
2. Random Forests from Scikit-Learn
3. Dense NNs and CNNs from Keras and Tensorflow
4. SVM from Scikit-Learn\
Finally, an ensemble classifier of the above base models is also built.
